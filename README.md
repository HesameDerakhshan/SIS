# Dynamics of disease spreading on the Scale Free network following the SIS rule

Generate a scale-free network of size N=10^3 with a power-law
degree distribution with degree exponent γ=2.2. Consider the dynamics of disease spreading on
the network following the SIS rule , such that infection rate β=0.1 and recovery rate μ=1.

* Plot fractions of infected and susceptible nodes in terms of time.
* Find the fraction of infected nodes at the stationary state.
* Change β from zero up to 0.5 and plot the stationary value of infected nodes in terms of
β.
